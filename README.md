# Sarcasm Detection in Code-Mixed Hinglish Tweets

An NLP project that automatically detects sarcasm in Hinglish (Hindi-English code-mixed) tweets using Machine Learning and Transformer-based models.

---

## Overview

Sarcasm detection is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing because sarcasm depends on context and implicit meaning. This challenge becomes even more difficult in code-mixed languages like Hinglish.

This project builds and compares multiple models to classify tweets as:

- Sarcastic  
- Non-Sarcastic  

Three different approaches were implemented and compared:

- Baseline Machine Learning Models  
- SMOTE-based Balanced Models  
- Transformer-based Multilingual BERT (mBERT)  

The transformer model achieved the best performance.

## Key Features

- Works on real Hinglish tweet dataset  
- Handles class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Compares traditional ML and Transformer models  
- Uses contextual embeddings with mBERT  
- Achieves high sarcasm detection performance

## Dataset

- Hinglish code-mixed tweets dataset  
- Binary classification:
  - 1 → Sarcastic  
  - 0 → Non-Sarcastic  
- Highly imbalanced dataset  

Example:
wah kya performance hai, bilkul world class

- Model Training:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - SVM  
  - Random Forest  
- Model Evaluation

### Notebook 2: SMOTE-Based Machine Learning Models

**Goal:** Handle class imbalance and improve detection.

Steps:

- Data Preparation  
- Text Preprocessing  
- TF-IDF Feature Extraction  
- Applied SMOTE balancing  
- Model Training:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - SVM  
  - Random Forest  
  - Naive Bayes  
- Model Evaluation

### Notebook 3: Transformer-Based mBERT Model

**Goal:** Use contextual embeddings for best performance.

Steps:

- Data Preparation  
- Text Preprocessing  
- Label Encoding  
- Train-Test Split  
- Tokenization using mBERT tokenizer  
- Fine-tuning pre-trained mBERT  
- Model Evaluation

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression (Baseline) | 93.29% | 0.67 |
| Support Vector Machine (SMOTE) | 94.6% | 0.75 |
| mBERT Transformer | **96.67%** | **0.8372%** |

Conclusion:

- Baseline models failed due to imbalance  
- SMOTE improved sarcasm detection  
- mBERT achieved best performance
